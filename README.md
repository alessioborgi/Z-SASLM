## Overview üöÄ

**Z-SASLM** redefines multi-style image synthesis by leveraging Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLI) for zero-shot style alignment. It harnesses the non-linear geometry of the latent space for smooth, high-fidelity blending‚Äîwithout any fine-tuning.

This work has been **accepted to the CVPR 2025 Workshop on AI for Creative Visual Content Generation, Editing and Understanding**, where we showcase its theoretical brilliance and practical versatility in multi-modal content fusion.

## Abstract ‚ú®

> We introduce **Z-SASLM**, a **Zero-Shot Style-Aligned SLI (Spherical Linear Interpolation) Blending Latent Manipulation** pipeline that overcomes the limitations of current multi-style blending methods. Conventional approaches rely on linear blending, assuming a flat latent space leading to suboptimal results when integrating multiple reference styles. In contrast, our framework leverages the non-linear geometry of the latent space by using SLI Blending to combine weighted style representations. By interpolating along the geodesic on the hypersphere, Z-SASLM preserves the intrinsic structure of the latent space, ensuring high-fidelity and coherent blending of diverse styles‚Äîall without the need for fine-tuning. We further propose a new metric, Weighted Multi-Style DINO VIT-B/8, designed to quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the blended styles. While our primary focus is on the theoretical and practical advantages of SLI Blending for style manipulation, we also demonstrate its effectiveness in a multi-modal content fusion setting through comprehensive experimental studies. Experimental results show that Z-SASLM achieves enhanced and robust style alignment.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alessioborgi/Z-SASLM.git
cd Z-SASLM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start üöÄ

Here's a simple example to get you up and running:

```python
from z_saslm import ZSASLM

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = ZSASLM()

# Define source and style images
source_image = "path/to/source_image.jpg"
style_images = ["path/to/style1.jpg", "path/to/style2.jpg"]

# Perform SLI Blending
result = pipeline.blend(source_image, style_images)

# Save the blended image
result.save("path/to/output_image.jpg")
```
